🚴 Bike Sharing Dashboard for Smart Cities

A Power BI dashboard that analyzes bike-sharing data from multiple cities to help understand how well the system is working.
📊 What This Project Does
This dashboard shows:

How many bikes are being used
- Which cities perform best
- When bikes are used the most
- Which stations need attention

🔧 Tools Used

Power BI - For creating the dashboard
DAX - For calculations and metrics

📈 Key Features
Data Model

Connected different data tables
Created relationships between stations and usage data

Calculations Created
- **Day Type:** Marks weekend vs weekday.
- **Station Status:** Shows if station is active or inactive.
- **Peak Hours:** Identifies busy times (5 PM - 8 PM).

Metrics Tracked
- Total bikes available
- Total capacity
- How much the system is being used (Utilization %)
- Number of stations in critical condition
- Free bike slots available

🎯 Main Findings
Overall Stats
- 20,000 bikes in the system
- 57,000 total capacity
- 34% utilization (bikes are underused)
- 986 stations total
- 750 stations need urgent attention

Best Performing Cities
- Lyon - 6,000 bikes used
- Toulouse - 5,000 bikes used
- Bruxelles-Capitale - 5,000 bikes used

Worst Performing Cities
- Vilnius - Only 1,000 bikes used
- Luxembourg - Only 1,000 bikes used

Problems Found
- System only works at 34% capacity (should be 60-70%)
- 76% of stations are in critical condition
- Huge difference between peak hours and off-peak hours
- Weekdays have very low usage

💡 Recommendations

Fix critical stations first
 - Move bikes to high-demand areas
 - Encourage more weekday usage
 - Focus on top-performing cities

**What Needs to Be Done**
<ul>
  <li>Fix critical infrastructure - Focus on repairing 750 stations.</li>
  <li>Redistribute bikes - Move bikes to high-demand areas.</li>
  <li>Increase weekday usage - Create programs to encourage more rides.</li>
  <li>Exit low-performing markets - Stop investing in cities with poor results.</li>
</ul> 

📝 Conclusion
Current Situation
<ul>
  <li>The bike-sharing system is working at only 34% capacity with 76% of stations in critical condition. </li>
  <li>There's a huge drop in usage during weekdays (99% less than peak hours). </li>
  <li>Cities like Lyon and Toulouse are doing well, but cities like Vilnius and Luxembourg are struggling.</li>
</ul>
